		<h3>
			Why Good | Evil?
		</h3>
		<p>
			We are an experimental space that values individual anonymity in an age where every move we make, and phrase we utter, is broadcast to the world. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We believe goodness and evil exist, sometimes difficult to differentiate in the margins, and so our challenge to the anonymous is can you discern the difference in the cacophony of todayâ€™s existence? Share your thoughts on the matter: Can you discuss it? Can you handle it?
